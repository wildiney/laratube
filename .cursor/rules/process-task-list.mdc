# Task List Management

Guidelines for managing task lists in markdown files to track progress on completing a PRD.

## Task Implementation
- **One sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start the next sub-task until you ask the user for permission and they say "yes" or "y".
- **Completion protocol:** 
  1. When you finish a **sub-task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.
  2. If **all** subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, also mark the **parent task** as completed.
- Stop after each sub-task and wait for the user's go-ahead.
- **New subtasks:** Ask the user for confirmation before adding any new subtasks.

## Task List Maintenance
1. **Update the task list as you work:** 
    - Mark tasks and subtasks as completed `[x]` per the protocol above.
    - Add new tasks only with explicit user approval.
2. **Maintain the "Relevant Files" section:**
    - List every file created or modified.
    - Give each file a one-line description of its purpose.

## AI Instructions
1. Before starting work, check which sub-task is next.
2. After implementing a sub-task, update the file **and pause for user approval** before proceeding.
3. Follow the completion protocol:
   - Mark each finished **sub-task** `[x]`.
   - Mark the **parent task** `[x]` once **all** its subtasks are `[x]`.
4. Add newly discovered tasks only after user confirmation.
5. Keep the "Relevant Files" section accurate and up to date.
6. Define “significant work” as:
   - Completion of a sub-task,
   - Implementation of a PRD section, or
   - Major refactoring affecting multiple files.
7. Never make automatic changes to the task list without explicit user consent.
